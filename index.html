   <h1>The Tricky Tortoise</h1>     
   <p><strong>long time ago</strong> in a village in the outskirt of lagos there lived a tortoise named toto,Toto was a very tricky animal who always tricked ,cheated other animal by colleting their food saying it was the will of the king,as of then the Elephant was king according to their tradition <em> which says that the wisest animal will be king</em>,toto continued this act until one of the animal named <em>chichi[a bird]</em> reported to the king about this the king thought very well of this and said let us leave him for now because we haven't caught him red handed ,toto went out the next day to continue his usual thing and as he decided to collect ayo[monkey] banana then two lion which lay in ambush for tortoise rose up and pounced on him and dragged him to the palace as they went toto pleaded and pleaded but all of his pleading fell on deaf ear and as they reached the palace the king was already waiting for him and didnt know what to do concerning his case so he sent his servant to bring their kingdom rule book and began reading every offence and punishment one by one </p>  

   <h2> Kingdom Rules</h2>   
   <ol>   
	   	<li>stealing=flogging</li>   
	   	<li>killin=death by any mean</li>    
	   	<li>cheating=flogging </li>
   	</ol>  
   	So toto was flogged and during the process the cane shattered his shell on his back that is why the tortoise has a rough apperance and since then toto vowed to never go near any animaL that is why you rarely see a tortoise in the wild.
